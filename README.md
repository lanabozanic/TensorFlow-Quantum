# TensorFlow Quantum Using mnist Dataset
This tutorial builds a quantum neural network (QNN) to classify a simplified version of MNIST, similar to the approach used in Farhi et al. The performance of the quantum neural network on this classical data problem is compared with a classical neural network.
